  title : "What to Know About Our Pricing"
  content : "
•	Cocktail Count: We calculate an average of 3 cocktails per guest to ensure there’s enough for everyone.
<br/>
<br/>
•	Custom Cocktail Options: While we do not offer a full bar option, we are happy to work with you to create a customized cocktail menu. This approach allows us to maintain the highest quality and consistency while minimizing wait times for your guests.
<br/>
<br/>
•	Select up to 3 cocktails from our Menu: We suggest no more than 3 craft cocktails to serve at your event. This limits guest wait time and reduces the likelihood that supplies for any single cocktail may run out during service. 
<br/>
<br/>
•	Guest-Supplied Alcohol: We do not provide alcohol directly, but we will facilitate the process by building a custom shopping list for your event. Alcohol will be purchased directly by you, and we’ll pick it up and ensure everything is ready before the event begins.
<br/>
<br/>
•	Bar Setup: Our pricing includes the full bar setup and transport of all essential materials. This includes ice, glasses, garnishes, syrups, and bar tools.
<br/>
<br/>
•	Labor: Each event includes 8 hours of service per bartender to cover set-up, the event, and tear-down. For a 50-guest event, you’ll have 2 bartenders. For 75 guests, it’s 3 bartenders, and for 100 guests, you’ll have 4 bartenders.
<br/>
<br/>
•	Premium Service: We use premium Penny Pound ice and Tossware 12oz rocks glasses to ensure each cocktail is served with the same level of quality you’d expect at a craft cocktail bar.
<br/>
<br/>
•	Non-Alcoholic Options: We provide soda, soda water, and bottled water for non-drinking guests. This is included in the total cost.
<br/>
<br/>
•	Day-of Insurance: Every event is fully insured to give you peace of mind.
<br/>
<br/>
•	Transparent Pricing: We provide you with a clear, transparent cost breakdown so you know exactly what you’re paying for, with no hidden fees.
